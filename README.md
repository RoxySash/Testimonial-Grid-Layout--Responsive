### What I learned

I managed to get the opactitiy of the colors by chnaging the colors from hsl to rgba the a stands for alpha which would denote the opactity of the text this number ranges from 0 to 1. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 :root {
    --primary-color: hsl(263, 55%, 52%); /* Moderate violet */
    --secondary-color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%); /* Very dark grayish blue */
    --third-color: hsl(219, 29%, 14%); /* Very dark blackish blue */
    --fourth-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /* White */

    --neutral-color-one: hsl(0, 0%, 81%); /* Light gray */
    --neutral-color-two: hsl(210, 46%, 95%); /* Light grayish blue */

    /* transparency with rgb 50% and 70%* rgba adds alpha which uses 0 - 1 transparency */

    --violet-50-color: rgba(117, 65, 200, 0.5);
    --violet-70-color: rgba(117, 65, 200, 0.7);
    --gray-50-color: rgba(72, 85, 106, 0.5);
    --gray-70-color: rgba(72, 85, 106, 0.7);
    --blue-50-color: rgba(25, 33, 46, 0.5);
    --blue-70-color: rgba(25, 33, 46, 0.7);
    --white-50-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
    --white-70-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);




  }
```


### Continued development

I will work on more projects that include grid its a challenging concept it is challenging if you understand it I personally prefer flexbox.
