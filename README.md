## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I managed to get the opactitiy of the colors by chnaging the colors from hsl to rgba the a stands for alpha which would denote the opactity of the text this number ranges from 0 to 1. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
 :root {
    --primary-color: hsl(263, 55%, 52%); /* Moderate violet */
    --secondary-color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%); /* Very dark grayish blue */
    --third-color: hsl(219, 29%, 14%); /* Very dark blackish blue */
    --fourth-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%); /* White */

    --neutral-color-one: hsl(0, 0%, 81%); /* Light gray */
    --neutral-color-two: hsl(210, 46%, 95%); /* Light grayish blue */

    /* transparency with rgb 50% and 70%* rgba adds alpha which uses 0 - 1 transparency */

    --violet-50-color: rgba(117, 65, 200, 0.5);
    --violet-70-color: rgba(117, 65, 200, 0.7);
    --gray-50-color: rgba(72, 85, 106, 0.5);
    --gray-70-color: rgba(72, 85, 106, 0.7);
    --blue-50-color: rgba(25, 33, 46, 0.5);
    --blue-70-color: rgba(25, 33, 46, 0.7);
    --white-50-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
    --white-70-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7);




  }
```
